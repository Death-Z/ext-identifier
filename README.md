## How do I add my patterns?
In the first lines of the main you can add your own patterns, use HxD (or any Hexadecimal editor) and try to find a pattern in the first **64** bytes of a file, after that add it to the vector as first value (eg: ftypisom), and the second value the name of the extension (eg: mp4)
